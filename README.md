# volunteerSitesCodeSnippets
A place for me to house a bunch of snippets of code that I use for sites that I volunteer to help out. They are:
* [New Forest Earth](http://www.newforestearth.org/v0.2/home/)
* [Peace Core Volunteer Resource](http://www.pcvresource.com/)
* [e.thePeople](http://ethepeople.org/)

Feel free to improve on the code, it's mostly jQuery snips & some custom CSS for WordPress sites.
